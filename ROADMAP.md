# Roadmap

## v0.2

### Janitorial

- [x] Use a `dev` branch from now on
- [ ] Automatically load all `.ass` files in [/spec/fixtures] when `fixtures` is not defined.
- [ ] Perhaps remove the `/examples` directory; requires a lot of upkeep
- [ ] Proper examples in [EXAMPLES.md]
- [ ] Thin out the specs:
  - [ ] Remove unneccessary repeated elements that provide context unimportant to syntax highlighting
  - [ ] Remove duplicates
  - [ ] Remove tests aimed at interpretation rather than representation (for instance, uppercase vs lowercase testing, or logical dependencies)

### Community

- [ ] import additional specs from [language-gfm]
- [ ] import/check issues from [language-gfm]
